# Introduction

Geospatial regression analysis considers spatial dependencies and relationships among geographic data points. This project demonstrates advanced geospatial regression using OLS, GWR, and MGWR on the "naturalearth_lowres" dataset. We aim to predict GDP per capita based on population density and other relevant variables while considering spatial dependencies and employing advanced spatial econometric techniques.
